# SimpleFileSearch

SimpleFileSearch is a desktop file search tool that does not use indexing. It is simple and easy to use, allowing you to search for everything, including file contents.

* It is intended for small folders; avoid searching your entire disk drive — you may regret it! 😅

This code was originally written in 2009, but recently, out of boredom, I updated it to .NET 6+ and migrated the UI to Avalonia. It may (or may not) work on other operating systems.


## TODO
- [ ] Allow remove from search history
- [ ] Checkbox to ignore accents
- [ ] Textbox to limit file size for contents search
- [ ] Add a cancel button during searches
