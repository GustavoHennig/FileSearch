# SimpleFileSearch

FileSearch is a desktop file searcher without indexing. It is simple and easy to use, allowing you to search everything, including file contents.

* It has a very specific use case for small folders, so avoid searching your entire disk drive—you may regret it! 😅

This code was originally written in 2009, but recently, out of boredom, I updated it to .NET 6+ and migrated the UI to Avalonia. It may (or may not) work on other operating systems.
